The first version, available at https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere/github-contents-worker was hosted at Cloudflare.

However, it became evident quickly that Cloudflares woker limits are too limited for downloading a large zipfile and unzipping it.

I therefore changed everything to use the [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions). The first problem I encountered is it's not so straightforward to create a catch-all endpoint - something that was easy with Cloudflare, due to the routing mechanism Vercel and Next has implemented everywhere.

However, I found a neat little trick; my setting my `vercel.json` to this, ensures everything leads to `index.ts`.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/:path*",
      "destination": "/api/index.ts"
    },
    {
      "source": "/",
      "destination": "/api/index.ts"
    }
  ],
  "functions": { "api/*.ts": { "maxDuration": 60, "memory": 1024 } },
  "public": true
}
```

Also, the max duration of the function is now 60s, the max for the free plan. This is quite a lot.

## Streaming instead of naive unzip library

After hosting it on vercel, things still didn't go well. After switching `fflate` into `unzipper`, things become much faster and I can now download big repos of over 100MB without timing out.

I tried isomorphic-git. However, it doesn't support `--filter blob:none` yet which makes it too slow to put on a vercel function.

See https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/1123 and https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/685#issuecomment-455423505

Also, `git` through `child_process` also doesn't seem to work on vercel easily.

If that would work, maybe this would be a great way to get all logging information for any repo, including recent changes and all kinds of statistics.

For now let's let it pass.

Discovered github has this feature too, at least for PR's:

> ProTip! Add .patch or .diff to the end of URLs for Gitâ€™s plaintext views.

When did this get added? Is it part of the API? Let's proxy this feature so I have it documented.
