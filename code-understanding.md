1. api to get raw code as a string
2. ask proper questions to a 1M+ tokens context model
3. keep this deterministic enough
4. put the results in a kv-store and serve it in a serverless freemium openapi.

This works incredibly well. Next steps:

- Move to vercel: https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration
- use together with gemini pro 1M context
- make openapi for agentops.ai open source repo.
